# AGENTS.md — Tiered Build And Repair

Space Engineers 1 mod. Part of Chris's mod collection under
[`gitpush-mod`](https://github.com/gitpush-mod).

## What this is

Tiered Build and Repair — progressive build/repair mechanics.

## For agents

- **Game:** Space Engineers 1
- **SE modding skill:** Chris has an SE modding Claude skill (source:
  [`Godimas101/se-claude-skill`](https://github.com/Godimas101/se-claude-skill)) —
  use it when working on this mod
- **SDK:** `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineersModSDK\`
- **Vanilla SBCs (authoritative for TypeId/SubtypeId + schema baselines):**
  `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Content\Data\`
- **Workshop mods (reference / dependencies):**
  `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\244850\`

## Development principles (shared across all Chris's SE mods)

1. **Backward compatibility.** Never break existing CustomData or save games.
   Add new config keys, don't remove or rename.
2. **Performance first.** Cache subgrid scans, minimize LINQ, defensive parsing.
3. **Null safety.** Always check block/component existence before use.
4. **Match existing style.** Follow the patterns already in this codebase.

## MUST NOT

- Modify vanilla SE game files (`steamapps/common/SpaceEngineers/`)
- Rename or delete workshop content
- Upload repo `Sandbox` files to a live SG server (wipes auto-pulled dependencies)
- Break save-game compatibility without explicit version bump
